## Branch

There are 5 major branchlines:
1. develop
2. feature
3. release
4. hotfix
5. master

### Develop
Branch *develop* is a long-running branch.
Branch *develop* should be stable.
Never push a commit to develop directly.
Branches *feature-M* start from branch *develop*.

### Feature
Branch *feature-M* should define a certain feature.
After work on a feature is completed, branch *feature-M* is merged into branch *develop*.
Once merged, the branch *feature-M* is deleted.

### Release
Branch *master* is a long-running branch.
Once all features are completed for a relase, branch *release-N* starts from branch *develop*.
Never create branch *feature-M* in branch *release-N*.
Never merge branch *relase* into branch *develop*.

### Hotfix
Branch *hotfix-M* should define a certain fix.
After work on a fix is completed, branch *hotfix-M* is merged into branch *release*.
Once merged, the branch *hotfix-M* is deleted.

5. Oh, I mistakenly committed in master/develop. What should I do? 

    - Repent at your nearest place of worship

    - If you havenâ€™t pushed...
    ```bash
    # Make a new branch with the new commits
    git checkout -b new-branch
    # Push a new branch with the new commits
    git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
    # Go back to develop
    git checkout develop
    # Reset develop back to it's original state
    # [Note: 1 for single commit, replace 1 with number of commits]
    # use git log to verify.
    git reset --hard HEAD~1

    # You can also use --soft and stash the changes to new branch
    # but you have to re-commit
    ```
    - If you have pushed... let someone know.


6. Hey, I've got a conflict on rebase, what should I do?
```bash
# Look for conflict files [both modified section]
git status -u
# Fix the conflict on *both modified files*
vim conflicts-files.extension
# Make sure all the files are ready to add (in order to not add unwanted files, update .gitignore)
git status -u
# Add all the files
git add .   # (Update .gitignore for unrelated repo files)
# Continue rebase patch
git rebase --continue
# Push
git push
# if your branch is diverged, you can use use `git push --force`
# But make sure others are not working in that branch
```
